# Topic Modeling of Sci-Fi novels
The primary result of our research is the application of topic modeling NLP techniques to the Project Gutenberg corpus, which can be found in [Poster.pdf](https://github.com/redcitylights/SciFi_Topic_Modeling/blob/main/Poster.pdf).

Though, you'll need to run this notebook locally, because the Gutenberg python module provided by Google is out of date.
